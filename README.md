### Bug Bounty

Between October 2 and 8, anyone who finds a compromising fault that could lead to funds being lost or contracts being frozen in our Staking smart contracts will earn themselves a cool 10,000 DAI. Weâ€™re very confident in our work, but believe incentivizing the wider Ethereum community to examine our contracts is the right thing to do.

If you have questions or find something then please create a github issue with the details.
